In my free time, I develop several open source projects.

## Highlights

[TrieHash](triehash) generates implementations for perfect hash functions in
pure C.

[DNS66](dns66) is an application for Android operating systems that allows you
to block hosts and especially ad-hosts at the DNS level.

## Other tools

[dh-autoreconf](dh-autoreconf) is a helper for Debian packaging that involves
running build system file generators like autoreconf at build time.

[dir2ogg](dir2ogg) is a command-line tool written in Python that converts
various Audio formats into Ogg Vorbis.

[hardlink](hardlink) is a command-line tool that links identical files in
directories together.

[ndisgtk](ndisgtk) is a graphical frontend to ndiswrapper. It's not really
used anymore.
