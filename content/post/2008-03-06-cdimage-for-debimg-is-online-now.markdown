debimg's  cdimage is now online at [http://jak-linux.org/cdimage/](http://jak-linux.org/cdimage/), and contains daily-builds of Debian testing netinst disks for i386 and amd64 architectures.

debimg is a new software which aims to replace debian-cd. No code has been released yet, but will be in the next days.

Please note that I can only provide jigdo images, because of bandwith and storage.

I will soon add build logs, and files listing the differences compared to original netinst images. I will also add support for more architectures.
