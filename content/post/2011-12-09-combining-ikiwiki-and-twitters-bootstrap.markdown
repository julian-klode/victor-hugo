Just because Julien did it, I moved my website to almost the same design now. Still using ikiwiki, of course. I'm still missing a few things, such as marking the currently active page in the menu, but I hope to get that done as well soon. Go  to [http://jak-linux.org/](http://jak-linux.org/) to see it.
