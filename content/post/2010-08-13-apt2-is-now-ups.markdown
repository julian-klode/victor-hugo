APT2 is now called UPS (Universal Package System). The name is inspired by [the company that delivers packages in those brown trucks](http://ups.com/) and from the Image Packaging System (IPS) of OpenSolaris; and mvo writing ups after I proposed upt (über package tool) in IRC. It's definitely better than my first thought which was 'moo' (and libmoo).

Update: OK, let's cancel this rename insanity.
